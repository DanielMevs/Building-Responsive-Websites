Use Good Icons

1 - Use a good icon pack, there are tons of free
    and paid icon packs.
    - You can just use emojis as well

2 - Use only one icon pack. Don't mix icons from
    different icon packs.

3 - Use SVG icons or icon fonts. Don't use bitmap
    image formats (.jpg and .png)

    Bitmap
        - "Regular images", JPG, PNG, GIF
        - Do not scale, become unsharp
    
    Vector-Based
        - SVG images and icon fonts
        - Scale indefinitely

4 - Adjust to website personality! Roundness,
    weight and filled/outlined depend on typo-
    graphy

When to Use Icons

5 - Use icons to provide visual assistance to text

6 - Use icons for product feature blocks

7 - Use icons associated with actions, and label
    them (unless no space or icon is 100% clear)

8 - Use icons as bullet points

Use Icons well

9 - To keep icons neutral, use same color as text.
    To draw more attention, use a different color

10 - Don't confuse your users: icons need to make
    sense and fit the text or action

11 - Don't make icons larger than what they were
    designed for. If needed, enclose them in a 
    shape
