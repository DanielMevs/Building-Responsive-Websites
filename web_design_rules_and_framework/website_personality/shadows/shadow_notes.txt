Use Shadows Well

1 - You don't have to use shadows! Only use the if it makes
    sense for the website personality.

    - The more serious or elegant you want to come across,
        the less shadow you would use - The more playful or fun you
         are trying to come accross, the more shadow you would use.


2 - Use shadows in small doses: don't add shadows to every element!


3 - Go light on shadows, don't make them too dark!


Use Shadows in the Right Situation

4 - Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand
    out (to draw attention)


5 - Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand
    out a bit more


6 - Use large shadows for elements that should really float
    above the interface.


7 - Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction
    (click and hover)


8 - Bonus: Experiment with glows (colored shadows)
