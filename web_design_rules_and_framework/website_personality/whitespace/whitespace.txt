Why Whitespace

- The right amount of whitspace makes designs look
    clean, modern and polished

- Whitespace communicates how different pieces of
    information are related to one another

- Whitespace implies inviible relationships bet-
    ween the elements of a layout.

Where to Use Whitespace

1 - Use tons of whitspaces between sections

2 - Use a lot of whitespace between groups
    of elements.
    - There is usually or vertical whitespace 
        than there is hornizontal ws.

3 - Use white between elements

4 - Inside groups of elements, try to use
    whitespace instead of lines.

How Much Whitespace?

5 - The more some elements (or groups of elements)
    belong together, the closer they should be!
    L> This is known as the "Law of Proximity"

6 - Start with a lot of whitespace, maybe even 
    too much! Then remove whitespace from there.
    L> Too much whitespace looks detached, while
        too little looks too crammed.
    L> Make sure elements have room to breathe,
        but not too detached or crammed.

7 - Match other design choices. If you have big
    text or big icons, you need more whitespace.

8 - Try a hard rule, such as using multiples of
    16px for all spacing.
