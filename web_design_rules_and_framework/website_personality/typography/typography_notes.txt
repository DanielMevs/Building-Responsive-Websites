Typography

- Typography is the art and technique of arranging
type to make written language legible, readable,
and appealing when displayed.

Serif vs Sans-Serif

Serif
- Serif has tails at the ends called serifs.
- Creates a traditional/classic look and feel.
- Conveys trustworthiness
- Good for long text 

Sans Serif
- Do not have tails at the end
- Modern look and feel
- Clean and simple
- Easier to choose for beginner designer

    it safe.

- It's okay to use just one typeface per page!
    If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces

- Choose the right typeface according to your
    website personality
    - Choose the right personality for your
        website
    - Decide between a serif and sans-serif 
        typeface
    - Experiment with all the "good" typefaces
        (and other typefaces from Google Fonts!)
        to see which ones best fits your web-
        site's message (this will come with 
        experience)
    -You can keep trying different typefaces
        as you design and build the page

Use Good Font Sizes and Weights

- When choosing font-sizes, limit choices!
    Use a "type scale" tool or other pre-
    defined range.
- Use a font size between 16px and 32px for
    "normal" text
-For long text (like a blog post), try a size of
    20px or even bigger
- For headlines, you can go really big (50px+)
    and bold (600+), depending on personality
- For any text, don't use a font weight under
    400 (regular)

Create a Good Reading Experience 
- Use less than 75 characters per line
- For normal-sized text, use a line height
    between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below
    1.5
        - The smaller or longer the text,
            the larger the line height
            needs to be!
- Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if 
    it looks unnatural(this will come from 
    experience)
- Experiment with all caps for short titles.
    Make them small and bold and increase letter-
    spacing
- Usually, don't justify text
- Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks
    are fine.
