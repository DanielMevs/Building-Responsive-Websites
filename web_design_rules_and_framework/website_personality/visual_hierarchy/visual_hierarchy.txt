What is Visual Hierarchy?

- Visual hierarchy is about establishing
    which elements of a design are the 
    most important ones

- Visual hierarchy is about drawing
    attention to those most important
    elements.

- Visual hierarchy is about defining a
    "path" for users, to guide them
    through the page.

- We use a combination of position, size,
    colors, spacing, borders, and shad-
    ows to establish a meaningful visual
    hierarchy between elements/components.


Visual Hierarchy Fundamentals


1 - Position important elements closer to
    the top of the page, where they get
    more attention.
    L> Attention flows down the page

2 - Use images mindfully, as they draw a
    lot of attention (larger images get
    more attention)

3 - Whitespace creates separation, so use
    whitespace strategically to emphasize
    elements.

4 - For text elements, use font size, font
    weight, color, and whitespace to con-
    vey importance

5 - What text elements to emphasize?
    L> Titles, sub-titles, links,
        buttons, data points, icons.
    L> You can also de-emphasize less
        important text, like labels
        or secondary/additional
        information.

    
Visual Hierarchy Between Components 


6 - Emphasize an important component using
    background color, shadow, or border
    (or multiple)

7 - Try emphasizing some component
    A over component B by de-emphasizing
    component B.

8 - What components to emphasize?
    L> Testimonials, call-to-action
        sections, preview cards,
        forms, pricing tables,
        important rows/columns
        in tables, etc...
