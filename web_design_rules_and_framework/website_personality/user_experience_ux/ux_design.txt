What is User Experience (UX)?

"Design is not just what it looks like and feels
like. Design is how it works."
- Steve Jobs

User Interface (UI) is the visual presentation
of a product. It's how the graphical interface 
looks and feels like
L> Layout
L> Personality
L> Typography, colors, icons, etc.

User Experience (UX) is the overall experience 
the user has while interacting with the product.
L> Does the app feel logical and well thought out?
L> Does the navigation work intuitively?
L> Are users reaching their goals.

UI is graphical interface 
L> UI Design is what makes an interface beautiful

UX is experience with interface
L> UX Design is what makes an interface useful
and functional

UX Design Guiding Principle: Goals 
- A website or application exists for a reason:
a user has a goal for visiting it, and a busi-
ness has a goal for creating it.


UX Rules For Usability

1 - Don't design complicated layouts. Don't re-
invent the wheel. Use patterns that users know.

2 - Make your call-to-action the most prominent
element, and make the text descriptive.

3 - Use blue text and underlined text only for
links!

4 - Animations should have a purpose and be 
fast: between 200 and 500 ms.

5 - In forms, align labels and fields in a 
single vertical line, to make the form easier
to scan

6 - Offer user good feedback for all actions:
form errors, form success, etc... [web apps]

7 - Place action buttons where they will 
create an effect (law of locality)[web apps]


UX Rules for Website Content

8 - Use a descriptive, keyword-focused head-
line on your main page. Don't be vague or 
fancy!

9 - Only include relevant information, eff-
iciently! Cut out fluff and make the content 
100% clear.

10 - Use simple words! Avoid technical jargon
and "smart-sounding" words

11 - Break up long text with sub-headings,
images, block quotes, bullet points, etc...
