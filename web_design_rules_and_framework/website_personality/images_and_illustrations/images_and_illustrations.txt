    photos, illustrations, patterns

    So only use relevant images!

    looking stock images (not generic ones!)

4 - Try to show real people to trigger user's emotions

5 - If necessary, crop images to fit your message

6 - Experiment combining photos, illustrations and patterns


Handling Text On Images

    using a gradient)

8 - Position text into neutral image area

9 - Put text in a box

Some Technical Details

10 - To account for high-res-screens, make image dim-
    ensions 2X as big as their displayed size

    - Scale factor: Actual pixels the screen con-
        tains / Pixels represented on screen

    - On high-res screens, scale factor is 2x or even
        3x, on "normal" screens it's just 1x (1 physical
        pixel = 1 design pixel)

11 - Compress images for a lower file size and better
    performance.

12 - When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure
    they have the exact same dimensions
