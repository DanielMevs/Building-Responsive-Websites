STRATEGIES FOR SELECTING BREAKPOINTS

What are breakpoints?
L> The viewport width at which we
want our design to change
L> The pixel values we want to
put in all media queries

Bad Strategy:
L>Based on popular devices
L> If Apple came out with a 
new phone with new dimensions,
you'd have to go in and change 
the media queries for every 
application you ever built
L> Not practical

Good Strategy:
L> Based on screen width ranges
-> 600px -> 900px -> 1200px
Phones: between 300px - 500px
Tablets: 600px - 900px
Landscape tablets: 900px - 1100px
Desktops: 1200px or more

Perfect Strategy:
L> When design breaks down
L> Ignore devices and device
categories all together.
L> Only look at our content
and our design.
L> We start at a small screen
size (for mobile first) and
continue increasing the screen
size until the design breaks.
L> We put breakpoints wherever
the design starts to look weird
or out of place.
