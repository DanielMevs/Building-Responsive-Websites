What is CSS Grid?

CSS Grid
- CSS Grid is a set of CSS properties for building 2-dimensional
    layouts.
- The main idea behind CSS Grid is that we divide a container
    element into rows and columns that can be filled with its
    child elements
- In two-dimensional contexts, CSS Grid allows us to write less
    nested HTML and easier-to-read CSS
- CSS Grid is not meant to replace flexbox! Instead, they work 
    perfectly together. Need a 1D layout? Use flexbox. Need 
    a 2D layout? Use CSS Grid.

Basic CSS Grid Terminology
- Grid Container: where everything happens. Activated by setting
    display: grid 
- Grid Items: child elements of the grid container 
- Row Axis: imaginary horizontal line going along the grid container 
- Column Axis: imaginary vertical line running along the grid container
- Unlike flexbox, we cannot change the direction of the column and row
    of the axis.
- Grid lines: lines that divide the grid and separate the columns 
    and rows. Grid lines for a column or row is equal to the number
    of columns or rows we have plus 1. If we have 3 columns and 2
    rows, we have 4 grid lines dividing the columns and 3 grid lines
    dividing the rows.
- Grid cell: the areas created by the intersection of all these grid
     lines into which we can place our grid items (might be filled 
     by a grid item or not)
- Gutters (gaps): spaces around the grid item within a grid cell
- Grid track/row: a row in the grid
- Grid track/column: a column in the grid

Grid Container Attributes
1. - grid-template-rows: <track-size>
   - grid-template-columns: <track size>
        To establish the grid row and column tracks. One length unit
        for each track. Any unit can be used, new fr fills unused space.
2. - row-gap: 0 | <length>
    - column-gap: 0 | <length>
    - gap: 0 | <length>
        To create empty space between tracks
3. - justify-items: stretch | start | center | end
   - align-items: stretch | start | center | end
        To align items inside rows/columns (horizontally/vertically)
4. - justify-content: start | center | end | ...
   - align-content: start  center | end | ...
        To align grid inside grid container. Only applies if
        container is larger than the grid

Grid Items Attributes
1. - grid-column: <start line> / <end line> | span <number>
   - grid-row: <start line> / <end line> | span <number>
        To place a grid item into a specific cell, based on line numbers.
        span keyword can be used to span an item across more cells
2. - justify-self: stretch | start | center | end
   - align-self: stretch | start | center | end
        To overwrite justify-items/align-items for single items.
