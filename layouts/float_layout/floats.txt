Normal Flow
- Default positioning
- Element is "in flow"
- Elements are simply laid out according
    to their order in the HTML code
- Default positioning:
    position: relative

Absolute Positioning 
- Element is removed from the normal flow:
    "out of flow"
- No impact on surrounding elements, might
    overlap them
- We use top, bottom, left or right to 
    offset the element from its relatively
    positioned container
- Default Positioning:
    position: absolute 

Floats
- Element is removed from the normal flow:
    "out of flow"
- Text and inline elements will wrap around
    the floated element
- The container will not adjust its height to
    the element.
- Default positioning:
    float: left
    float: right
