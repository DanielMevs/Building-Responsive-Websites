What is Responsive Design?


--- Responsive Design

L> Design technique to make a webpage adjust
its layout and visual style to any possible
screen size (window or viewport size)

- In practice, this means that responsive 
design makes websites usable on all devices,
such as desktop computers, tablets, and 
mobile phones.

- It's a set of practices, not a separate
technology. It's all just CSS!



4 Ingredients of Responsive Design

1. Fluid Layouts 
2. Responsive Units
3. Flexible Images
4. Media Queries


--- Fluid Layouts

L> To allow webpage to adapt to the current
viewport width (or even height)

- Use % (or vh/ vw) unit instead of px for
elements that should adapt to viewport 
(usually layout)

- Use max-width instead of width 


--- Responsive Units

L> Use rem unit instead of px for most lengths

- To make it easy to scale the entire layout 
down (or up) automatically

- Helpful trick: setting 1rem to 10px for
easy calculations


--- Flexible Images

L> By default, images don't scale automatically
as we change the viewport, so we need to fix 
that

- Always use % for image dimensions, together
with the max-width property.


--- Media Queries

L> Brings responsive sites to life!

- To change CSS styles on certain viewport
widths (called breakpoints)



Desktop-first Vs. Mobile-first Development


--- Desktop First 

- Start writing CSS for the desktop: large screen

- Then, media queries shrink design to smaller
screens.


--- Mobile First

- Start writing CSS for mobile devices: small
screen 

- Then, media queries expand design to a large
screen

- Forces us to reduce websites and apps to the
absolute essentials.
