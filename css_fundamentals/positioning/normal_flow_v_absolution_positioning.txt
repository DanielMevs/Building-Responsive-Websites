***Normal Flow V. Aboolute Positioning***

NORMAL FLOW 
- Default positioning
- Element is "in flow"
- Elements are simply laid out according to their
    order in the HTML code
L> Default Positioning 
    position: relative

ABSOLUTE POSITIONING
- Element is removed from the normal flow:
    "out of flow"
- No impact on surrounding elements, might overlap
     them
- We use top, bottom, left, or right to offset the 
    element from its relatively positioned container
L> position: absolute
